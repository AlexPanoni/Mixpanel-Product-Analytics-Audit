# Product Analytics Audit: Retention & Monetization Strategy
> **A deep-dive behavioral audit using the Mixpanel Benchmark Social Dataset.**

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive lifecycle analysis designed to showcase my expertise as a **Product Analyst**. Utilizing a 12-month dataset of 100,000 users and ~1.5M events, I mapped the entire user journey—from high-friction onboarding to long-term monetization.

## 📊 Technical Deep-Dive

### 1. The Onboarding "Cliff" (Activation Analysis)
The platform features a high-friction **35.9-minute Time-to-Value (TTV)**. While this causes a 36% initial drop-off, it acts as a high-intent filter for long-term users.

### 2. Rare "Linear Decay" (Retention Analysis)
The platform exhibits incredible stability after the initial month.
* **Monthly Reach:** 81.5% (M1).
* **10-Month Persistence:** 52% survival rate.
* **The Bedrock:** The 50-week return rate (14%) aligns with the Daily Pulse (16%), indicating a "Life-Long" user core.

### 3. Path to Purchase (Monetization Analysis)
Reverse-engineering the `Upgrade` event revealed that revenue is driven by **Social Density** (network curation) rather than content consumption.

## 🧠 Strategic Insights & Recommendations
* **Optimize the "Activation Cliff":** Target the 36% churn in onboarding to accelerate "First Value."
* **Social Density Nudges:** Move "Passive Lurkers" into "Active Curators" to trigger monetization.
* **Lifecycle Win-Backs:** 25% of upgrades are returning users; automated re-acquisition should be tied to social activity spikes.

## 🛠 Tools & Data
* **Mixpanel:** Funnels, Retention (Linear & N-Day), Flows, Insights, and Cohort Analysis.
* **Analytical Frameworks:** TTV (Time-to-Value), Product-Market Fit (PMF) Bedrock, Behavioral Archetypes.
* **Data Transparency:** I have included the raw **`social_lexicon_data.csv`** in this repository. This file contains the anonymized event counts and cohort metrics pulled from Mixpanel that served as the foundation for the retention modeling and monetization correlations found in the report.
