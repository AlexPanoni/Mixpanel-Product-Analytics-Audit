# Product Analytics Audit: Retention & Monetization Strategy
> **A deep-dive behavioral audit using the Mixpanel Benchmark Social Dataset.**

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive lifecycle analysis designed to showcase my expertise as a **Product Analyst**. Utilizing a 12-month dataset of 100,000 users and ~1.5M events, I mapped the entire user journey—from high-friction onboarding to long-term monetization.

## 📊 Technical Deep-Dive

### 1. The Onboarding "Cliff" (Activation Analysis)
The platform features a high-friction **35.9-minute Time-to-Value (TTV)**. While this causes a 36% initial drop-off, it acts as a high-intent filter for long-term users.

### 2. Rare "Linear Decay" (Retention Analysis)
The platform exhibits incredible stability after the initial month.
* **Monthly Reach:** 81.5% (M1).
* **10-Month Persistence:** 52% survival rate.
* **The Bedrock:** The 50-week return rate (14%) aligns with the Daily Pulse (16%), indicating a "Life-Long" user core.

### 3. Path to Purchase (Monetization Analysis)
Reverse-engineering the `Upgrade` event revealed that revenue is driven by **Social Density** (network curation) rather than content consumption.

## 🧠 Strategic Insights & Recommendations
* **Optimize the "Activation Cliff":** Target the 36% churn in onboarding to accelerate "First Value."
* **Social Density Nudges:** Move "Passive Lurkers" into "Active Curators" to trigger monetization.
* **Lifecycle Win-Backs:** 25% of upgrades are returning users; automated re-acquisition should be tied to social activity spikes.
